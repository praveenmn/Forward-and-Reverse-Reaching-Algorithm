HEY!

The the code downloaded is in .m format which could executed in matlab.This code uses Forward and Reverse Reaching Algorithm to solve the inverse Kinemtatic of 3 link
kinematic chain. The lenght of each link can varied in meters.plot function traces the path as well for reference. Although this produce valid results and reduce the 
singularity problem greatly,yet there could be few more possible oreientation. These Differenet orientation can be achieved by selecting diffrent refernece axis.

When the code is executed a command prompt asks to select the element. Like 0',180'.... these are nothing but the reference axis,try diffrenent axis and have fun!!!!

just Read through the code, It is self explanatory.



Cheers!!!
